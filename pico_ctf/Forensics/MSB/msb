seems to  me,.can
not be t oo rigid
ly follo wed in t

avoid ev erything

,.indeed , in one
 sense a  protest
 against  it, and
 no man  abhorred
 it more .than Ce

k, any t emptatio

is after  all an.

he Maece nas of t

 one of  those.ch
atty con fidentia

the firs t hint o
f a fort hcoming 
Second P art. "Yo

of.Sanch o Panza.
" His id ea of "s

mewhat e lastic o
ne, for, .as we k

e than p oems, or
 pastora ls, or n

s dramat ic.ambit
ion that  engross
ed his t houghts.
 The sam e indomi
table sp irit tha
t.kept h im from 
despair  in the b

him to.a ttempt t
he escap e of him
self and  his com

again, m ade.him 
persever e in spi
te of fa ilure an
d discou ragement
 in his  efforts 
to.win t he ear o
f the pu blic as 
a dramat ist. The
 tempera ment of 
Cervante s.was es
sentiall y sangui
ne. The  portrait
 he draw s in the
 preface  to the.
novels,  with the
 aquilin e featur
es, ches tnut hai
r, smoot h untrou
bled.for ehead, a
nd brigh t cheerf
ul eyes,  is the 
very por trait of
 a sangu ine.man.
 Nothing  that th
e manage rs might
 say cou ld persu
ade him  that the
.merits  of his p
lays wou ld not b
e recogn ised at 
last if  they wer
e only.g iven a f
air chan ce. The 
old sold ier of t
he Spani sh Salam

was to f ound a g
reat nat ional dr
ama,.bas ed on th
e true p rinciple
s of art , that w
as to be  the env
y of all .nations
; he was  to driv

"mirrors  of nons

of folly " that w
ere in v ogue thr
ough.the  cupidit

 not onl y amuse

is he wa s to do,
 could h e once g

.He show s plainl
y enough , too, t
hat "Don  Quixote
" and th e demoli

s not th e work t
hat lay  next his
 heart.  He was,.
indeed,  as he sa

s prefac e, more 
a stepfa ther tha
n a.fath er to "D

er was g reat wor
k so neg lected b

at it wa s writte
n carele ssly, ha
stily, a nd by fi
ts and.s tarts, w
as not a lways hi
s fault,  but it 
seems cl ear he n
ever rea d what.h
e sent t o the pr

 the pri nters ha
d blunde red, but
 he.neve r took t
he troub le to co
rrect th em when 
the thir d editio
n was in .progres
s, as a  man who 
really c ared for
 the chi ld of hi
s brain  would.ha
ve done.  He appe
ars to h ave rega
rded the  book as
 little  more tha
n a.mere  libro d
e entret enimient
o, an am using bo
ok, a th ing, as 
he says  in.the "
Viaje,"  "to dive
rt the m elanchol
y moody  heart at
 any tim e or.sea
son." No  doubt h
e had an  affecti
on for h is hero,
 and was  very pr
oud.of S ancho Pa
nza. It  would ha
ve been  strange 
indeed i f he had
 not bee n.proud 
of the m ost humo
rous cre ation in
 all fic tion. He
 was pro ud, too,
.of the  populari
ty and s uccess o
f the bo ok, and 
beyond m easure.d
elightfu l is the
 naivete  with wh
ich he s hows his
 pride i n a doze
n.passag es in th
e Second  Part. B
ut it wa s not th

d have g iven all
 the suc cess of 
"Don Qui xote,".n
ay, woul d have s
een ever y copy o
f "Don Q uixote" 
burned i n the Pl
aza.Mayo r, for o
ne such  success 
as Lope  de Vega 
was enjo ying on 
an avera ge.once 
a week.. .And so 
he went  on, dawd
ling ove r "Don Q

a chapte r now.an
d again,  and put
ting it  aside to
 turn to  "Persil

bles ask ed when 
"Don Qui xote".wo
uld be r eady, th
e answer  no doub
t was: E n breve-
-shortly , there 
was.time  enough 
for that . At six
ty-eight  he was 
as full  of life 
and hope .and pla
ns for t he futur
e as a b oy of ei
ghteen.. .Nemesis
 was com ing, how
ever. He  had got
 as far  as Chapt

.his lei surely p

 before  October

us some  idea.of

 the onl y besom 
to.sweep  away th

l be suf ficientl
y clear  to those
 who.loo k into t
he evide nce; as 
it will  be also 
that it  was not 
chivalry .itself 
that he  attacked
 and swe pt away.
 Of all  the absu
rdities  that,.th
anks to  poetry, 
will be  repeated
 to the  end of t
ime, the re is no
.greater  one tha
n saying  that "C
ervantes  smiled 
Spain's  chivalry
 away.". In the f
irst pla ce there
 was no  chivalry
 for him  to smil
e away.  Spain's.
chivalry  had bee
n dead f or more 
than a c entury. 
Its work  was don

was not. chivalry
 but a d egrading

..A very  slight 
examinat ion of t

"Don Qui xote" wi
ll.suffi ce to sh
ow that  Cervante
s had no  deep de

 the boo k. When 
he wrote  those l

had no i dea of t

ittle do ubt that
 all he  contempl

for one  thing, t
hat Sanc ho Panza

 that Ce rvantes 
had some  intenti

in the f irst wor

...By th e time C

the case  was ver

that wha t they w

To himse lf, too,
 his cre ations h
ad becom e realit

become.p roud of 
them, es pecially
 of Sanc ho. He b

 more li ke that 
of a man .sure of

hange al so. In t
he First  Part, D

o charac ter or.i
ndividua lity wha
tever. H e is not
hing mor e than a
 crazy r epresent
ative.of  the sen

. In all  that he
 says an d.does h
e is sim ply repe

 he has  learned 
from his  books;.
and ther efore, i
t is abs urd to s

on his n obleness
,.disint erestedn

 busines s.of a k
night-er rant to

and succ our the.
distress ed, and 
this, as  a matte

makes hi s busine
ss when. he takes
 up the  part; a 
knight-e rrant wa
s bound  to be in
trepid,  and so.h
e feels  bound to
 cast fe ar aside
. Of all  Byron's
 melodio us nonse
nse.abou t Don Qu

nonsensi cal stat

he exact  opposit

it is hi s.madnes
s makes  him virt

 it, as  freely a

true the  amount 
of indiv iduality
 bestowe d upon D

t.very g reat. Th
ere are  some nat
ural tou ches of

him, suc h.as his

to Sanch o, it is
 plain,  from the
 conclud ing word
s of the  preface
 to.the  First Pa

a favour ite with

was too  true an 
artist t o spoil

 way. Sa ncho, wh

To have  a bout o

have giv en his h

on.that  ever mad

that was  that he
 fancied .it was 
right an d requis

 the sup port of

, that h e should

he set h imself f
orthwith  to put 
his sche me into.
executio n...The 
first th ing he d

up some  armour t
hat had  belonged
 to.his  great-gr

 lying f orgotten
 in a.co rner eat

 as best  he coul

 it.had  no close

 his ing enuity s
upplied,  for he 
contrive d a kind
 of half -helmet.

e that,  in order
 to see  if it wa

 to stan d a.cut,
 he drew  his swo

 couple  of slash

.which u ndid in 
an insta nt what 
had take n him a 
week to  do. The 
ease.wit h which

en, not. caring t

n thinki ng what

 said to  himself
) it was  not rig

belongin g to a k
night so  famous,
 and one  with su

This dis tressed

o all pr ecedent 
that so  good.a k

And so I  could n

that for  a coupl

 may wel l occupy
 him who  shall r
ead it.a ttentive
ly. The  discover
y of it  occurred
 in this  way...O
ne day,  as I was
 in the  Alcana o
f Toledo , a boy 
came up  to sell 
some.pam phlets a
nd old p apers to
 a silk  mercer, 
and, as  I am fon
d of rea ding.eve
n the ve ry scrap
s of pap er in th

y this n atural b
ent.of m ine I to
ok up on e of the
 pamphle ts the b
oy had f or sale,
 and saw .that it
 was in  characte
rs which  I recog
nised as  Arabic,
 and as  I was.un
able to  read the
m though  I could
 recogni se them,
 I looke d about 
to.see i f there 
were any  Spanish
-speakin g Morisc
o at han d to rea

or was t here any
 great d ifficult
y in fin ding suc
h an int erpreter
,.for ev en had I
 sought  one for 
an older  and bet
ter lang uage I s
hould.ha ve found
 him. In  short, 
chance p rovided 
me with  one, who
 when I  told.him
 what I  wanted a
nd put t he book 
into his  hands, 
opened i t in the
.middle  and afte
r readin g a litt
le in it  began t
o laugh.  I asked
 him.wha t he was
 laughin g at, an
d he rep lied tha
t it was  at some
thing th e.book h
ad writt en in th
e margin  by way 
of a not e. I bad
e him te ll it to
.me; and  he stil
l laughi ng said,
 "In the  margin,
 as I to ld you, 
this is. written:
 '_This  Dulcinea

ften men tioned i

he best  hand of 
any woma n in all

.When I  heard Du
lcinea d el Tobos
o named,  I was s
truck wi th surpr
ise and. amazemen
t, for i t occurr
ed to me  at once
 that th ese pamp

the hist ory of D

 this id ea I pre
ssed him  to read
 the.beg inning, 
and doin g so, tu

 offhand  into Ca

 me it m eant, "_

quired g reat cau

 the tit le of th

 bought  all the

known ho w eager 
I was fo r them, 
he might  have sa

on makin g more t

withdrew  at.once
 with th e Morisc

.him to  turn all

Go on wi th thy s

aid Don  Quixote,
 "and le ave the

."I say  then," c
ontinued  Sancho,

 the dau ghter of
 a rich  grazier,
 and thi s rich.g

."repeat ing twic

.."Tales  are alw

red Sanc ho, "and
 I canno t tell i

."Tell i t as tho

 Don Qui xote; "a

lord of  my soul,
" contin ued Sanc
